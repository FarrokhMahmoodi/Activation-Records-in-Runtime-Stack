# Activation-Records-in-Runtime-Stack

This C program examines activation records in runtime stacks.

You have to define 3 functions: f1(), f2(), and f3(). Run your program 3 times, calling only one of the functions on each execution.

Function f1() should meet the following requirements:

It must define a local array of char The size must be adjustable via define macro. The default size could be 1000.
It must also define a static int n that increments the number of activation records.
It must also define a static long int addr that stores the starting address of the array.
Then it must print the current activation record number, the memory address of the current array, followed by the estimated size of the current activation record as a distance (difference) between the current array address and the array address from the previous activation record.
Finally, it must recursively call itself, if the activation record count has not exceeded 10.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Here is a sample run of f1():

Call #1     at 000000000022FA30

AR Size     #1     is -2292272

Call #2     at 000000000022F610

AR Size     #2     is 1056

Call #3     at 000000000022F1F0

AR Size     #3     is 1056

Call #4     at 000000000022EDD0

AR Size     #4     is 1056

Call #5     at 000000000022E9B0

AR Size     #5     is 1056

AR Size     #8     is 1056

Call #9     at 000000000022D930

AR Size     #9     is 1056

Call #10    at 000000000022D510

AR Size     #10    is 1056

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Function f2() should meet the following requirements:

It must do everything f1() does, except this time the recursion never ends until segmentation fault.
In addition, in each call, it must print the estimated size of the runtime stack as a product of the size of current activation record and the total count of activation records so far.

Here is a sample run of f2() (towards the end):

Stack Si

---------------------------------------------------------

Function f3() should meet the following requirements:

It must do everything f1() does, except this time use malloc to dynamically allocate the array in the heap instead of stack.
Also, introduce another local variable, say, char c, to measure the size of the current activation record.
Make sure to free the array from the heap before recursive call to yourself.
As with f1(), make sure the recursion ends after 10 calls.
